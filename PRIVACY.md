# Privacy Policy for SwiftSkip - Ad Skipper & Speed Control

**Last Updated:** 2024-03-22

This Privacy Policy describes how SwiftSkip - Ad Skipper & Speed Control ("SwiftSkip", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects user data when you use our Chrome extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

**1. Information We Collect**

SwiftSkip collects the following types of information to provide and improve its core functionality:

*   **Personally Identifiable Information:**
    *   **Email Address:** If you choose to subscribe to premium features, we collect your email address through Google's authentication service. This is used to uniquely identify your account and manage your subscription.
*   **Authentication Information:**
    *   **OAuth 2.0 Access Token:** When you sign in with Google, we receive an OAuth 2.0 access token. This token is used to verify your identity and subscription status. It does not grant us access to your Google account or any other personal data.
*   **User Activity:**
    *   **Ad Interaction Data:** We collect anonymous statistics about the number of ads encountered and skipped, and the estimated time saved. This data is stored locally on your device and used to display statistics in the extension's popup. It is not associated with your email address or any other identifying information.
    *   **Video Playback Speed:** If you enable the "remember speed" feature, we store your preferred playback speed for each video. This is stored locally on your device using `chrome.storage.sync`.
*   **Website Content:**
    *   **YouTube Page Interaction:** SwiftSkip interacts with the content of YouTube pages to detect ads, modify video playback speed, and inject UI elements (e.g., the speed control overlay). We only access the content of YouTube pages when the extension is active and do not collect or store the content of videos you watch or any other browsing history.

**2. How We Use Information**

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

*   **To provide and improve SwiftSkip's core functionality:**
    *   Detect and skip ads.
    *   Adjust video playback speed.
    *   Remember user preferences (e.g., custom keyboard shortcuts, preferred playback speed).
    *   Display ad-related statistics to the user.
*   **To manage subscriptions:**
    *   Verify your subscription status.
    *   Associate your subscription with your email address.
*   **To communicate with you (if you are a subscribed user):**
    *   Send important updates or notifications regarding your subscription.

**3. Data Storage**

*   **User preferences and ad statistics** are stored locally on your device using `chrome.storage.sync`. This data is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.
*   **Subscription status** is verified using your email address and the OAuth 2.0 access token, which is used to communicate with our secure backend server that handles subscriptions.

**4. Data Sharing**

We do not sell or share your data with third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:

*   **Service Providers:** We use a secure third-party payment processor (e.g., PayPal) to handle subscription payments. We do not store your payment information ourselves. The payment processor will have its own privacy policy governing the use of your payment data.
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process.

**5. Data Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure.

**6. User Rights**

*   **Access and Control:** You can access and modify your stored preferences (e.g., keyboard shortcuts) through the extension's options page. You can also clear your ad statistics data from within the extension.
*   **Subscription Cancellation:** You can cancel your subscription at any time through the payment processor's website.
*   **Data Deletion:** If you uninstall SwiftSkip, your locally stored data will be removed from your device. If you wish to have your email address removed from our subscription database, please contact us.

**7. Children's Privacy**

SwiftSkip is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

**8. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the extension or through other appropriate channels.
